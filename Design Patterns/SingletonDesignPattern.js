// SINGLETON DESIGN PATTERN
// The singleton design pattern is a design pattern mostly used in cases where we need a single point of truth in our application. This design creates immutable instances of objects in our application.
// It could be created in two ways.
    // 1. Using Object literals
    // 2. Using Javascript classes.
